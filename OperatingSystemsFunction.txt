Operating systems provide a user interface for your computer.
The user interface can be called "UI" for short.
The user interface controls how you (the user) see information on the screen and interact with applications.
A graphical user interface (GUI) uses menus and images for interactions.
The command-line interface is a different method for entering data/instructions for the computer.
Commands are typically short keywords used to streamline the process.
Special keys and combinations on the keyboard can also do this.
