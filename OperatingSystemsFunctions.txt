Operating systems provide a user interface for your computer.
The user interface can be called "UI" for short.
The user interface controls how you (the user) see information on the screen and interact with applications.
A graphical user interface (GUI) uses menus and images for interactions.
The command-line interface is a different method for entering data/instructions for the computer.
Commands are typically short keywords used to streamline the process.
Special keys and combinations on the keyboard can also do this.
Operating systems also manage your computers memory usage.
This is meant to optimize the use of your computers memory.
RAM (random access memory) is one type of memory that your computer uses.
Your operating system can also use virtual memory to supplement RAM.
